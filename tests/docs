A few words about testing. I got quite stuck with this at the beginning and I still can't say for sure what was wrong.

Anyway, the methodology used here is following:
    1. create test in NetworkTest or EmbeddedTests package
    2. Create new module if needed
    3. Add whole module to correct __init__.py (use "from MyTests.py import *"
    4. Run tests.
