Tests are organized in two main modules: NetworkTests and EmbeddedTests, both of which are stored int testcases
directory in order to provide proper organization. Any testutils common for more than one test should be stored in
test_utils directory.

The testcases.__init__.py file has to store all .py files containing test cases using following pattern:
".TestPackage.TestFile import *"

All test cases names must start with 'test' to make them run.

While writing unittest remember the following:
    * each test case tests one thing only. If you have written a piece of code which, for example, sends and receives
    messages write separate tests for receiving and sending messages;
    * Remember to test for fail. In previous example this would mean writing additional tests for testing what happens
    if we send message in wrong format, receive something unexpected etc.
    * The code should be idiot-proof, so ensure you test for things such as wrong user input.
    * Tests should be simple. It's OK to compare testcase result with manual testing, but if you think it would be
    useful to test testcase for providing correct feedback it means your code organization sucks.
    * Unlike other cases it's OK to duplicate tested areas. More tests = better tests provided that you do it
    intelligently.
    * If you have any problems look at the code created earlier. You can also contact me via email.
